JAVA AND SELENIUM IDE

*what is java

java editor

java component

java process

Java phase have 3types
*development phase
File should be saved with (test.java)

*compilation phase
java c is used to compile
After compilation,file will be created as test.java

*excecution phase
JVM will execute the file and give an output

java program can developed by notepad,eclipse,netbean,intteli idea etc...

notepad,eclipse(we should no the syntax erroe while we creating the code)

STEP:
install jdk1.8
install Eclipse


*DATA MANIPULATION
storing the data nd retrieving the data

-storing data-store the data in java memory
-retrieving data- whenever we want get the data from java memory

3TYPES OF DATA TYPES

*primitive datatype
byte  =1bytes of data(-100to100)
short =2bytes of data
int   =4bytes of data
long  =8bytes of data
float =4bytes of data
double=8bytes of data
char  =2 bytes of data
boolean=1 bit of datatrue  or false

*non primitive datatype(we should say this as a inbuilt class in java)
String(inside the double cout we can us words or numerical)
Array

*Refference datatype

*int x=10;(x-only one time we can print the variable)

OPERATORS:
An operators can performs operation of an operands
+-,a b;

OPERATORS TYPES:
Arithemetic 
Relational [it gives only true or false]
logical[&,||,!]
&=all the condition should be satisfy
&&=if we use the double && the execution time will be fast

||=if any one condition is satisfy it give result
!=?
con-cordinational
stringx=sandeep
stringy=kumar
stringz=x+y=sandeepkumar

assignment(=)
Equivalent(==)
increment(++)
decrement(--)
conditional(?:)
Bitwise()
